            <p align="justify">Prize Bonds are a bearer type of security. These prize bonds are issued in series. Each series consist of less than 1,000,000 bonds. No fixed return is paid, but prize draws are held quarterly. Prize Bondâ€™s Scheme is the only lawful source for poor and middle-class people to become rich. But recently, profit rates on saving schemes like Defense Saving Schemes, Regular Income Certificates, Behbood Saving Certificates, Savings Accounts, and Special Saving Certificates have been increased by 8 to 50 basis points.<br>
